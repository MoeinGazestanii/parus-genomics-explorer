## 📌 Overview
This repository hosts the source code and static web pages for the **UPARUS (Useful Parus Sequences)** project. The platform provides public access to genomic resources and metadata of birds from the *Parus* genus (most notably the great tit, *Parus major*). 

The goal of this project is to provide a database of sequence data and corresponding metadata to facilitate collaboration between researchers and provide public access to these datasets.

## ✨ Features
This web portal is designed as an interactive, static single-page application (SPA) featuring:
- **📍 Interactive Geographic Map:** Built with Plotly, visualizing sampling locations. Users can click on any location to dynamically filter the sequence data.
- **📊 Sequence Data Table:** A searchable and sortable database of samples, including MD5 checksums for data validation.
- **🔗 Direct Sciebo Integration:** Secure and direct download links routing users to the Sciebo cloud storage.
- **📄 Comprehensive Metadata:** Detailed information regarding sample collection and processing.
- **📚 Publications:** A curated list of related research papers and scientific publications with direct DOI links.

## 🛠️ Built With
The portal is purely static and hosted on **GitHub Pages**, ensuring fast loading times and zero server maintenance.
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Modern UI/UX with Inter font), JavaScript (DataTables for smart searching and filtering).
- **Data Processing (Backend preparation):** Python, Pandas, and Plotly were used to process the `.xlsx` metadata, generate MD5 checksums, and export the interactive HTML map and tables.
